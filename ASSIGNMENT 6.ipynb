    "# QUESTION 1: DEFINE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.\n",

    "# QUESTION 2: LIST DOWN THE BENEFITS OF OOP.\n",
    "-Simplicity: software objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear\n",
    "\n",
    "-Modularity: each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "-Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods\n",
    "\n",
    "-Extensibility: adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "4. BEHAVIOUR:\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
